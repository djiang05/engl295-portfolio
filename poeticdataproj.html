                    <p>
                        For our poetic data project, we each collected data on what we did for fun for about three weeks. We tracked each fun activity and the duration of said activity. 
                        <br><br>These activities only counted if we individually considered them to be fun, which was a subjective measure that varied person to person. For example, eating a granola bar wouldn’t count for a member who considers it nothing more than a quick, easy breakfast. However, if one member really loves granola bars, it could.
                        <br><br>After the initial data collection, we decided to separate the data into different categories. We landed on six different ones: socialization, social media, exercise, food, gaming and entertainment. 
                        <br><br>At first, we imagined our project as an interactive, color-coded bar graph on Canva that linked to different poetic elements about specific activities with visual elements like pictures and doodles. However, after receiving feedback from our peers, Lyra, and Ian, we realized we had two major issues: there was no overarching story that connected everything and it would be hard to capture the audience’s attention. 
                        <br><br>Attracting attention nowadays is hard, especially in a digital environment. According to “Born Digital,” an essay by Stephanie Strickland that characterizes the elements of e-literature, “attention itself is being reshaped, becoming a mix of deep and hyper, or focused and mobilized.” Because of this, we figured we needed to be very particular about how to draw the audience in. We also recognized the importance of allowing the audience to explore at their own rate, presenting them with an opportunity for “surfing, sampling, [and] multitasking,” which Strickland identified as the way people naturally and comfortably consume digital media.
                        <br><br>Therefore, to capture the audience’s attention, we decided to add a quiz. We were inspired by the “sitters and standers” piece by Alvin Chang, which begins with a quiz about general habits of the audience, which they can then follow throughout the rest of the data-heavy piece. At first, we struggled to find a way to implement a quiz on Canva. However, after some time we figured out how to embed a quiz from another online program called CodePen onto our opening page. 
                        <br><br>This quiz, similar to the one from “sitters and standers,” matches users with the character whose habits are most similar to theirs. By prompting the audience to identify with a character, we invite the audience to investigate further to see how their habits actually compare character by character. 
                        <br><br>This is the audience’s opportunity to explore. Each of the four character pages highlights specific data that correspond to each character while detailing the specific activities we did and why we think we gravitate to some categories while avoiding others. After reviewing one page, the audience has the opportunity to view another character’s data or look at trends across all four. 
                        <br><br>Working on this project, we learned about the differences between our majors, seeing correlations between our interests and the activities we did. For example, upon analyzing the data, it makes sense that the journalism student, someone who relies on speaking to sources to write articles for their classes and extracurriculars, would find more pleasure socializing than the other students because she is naturally outgoing, which is a personality trait that impacted her decision to study journalism in the first place. It also makes sense that the chemistry major in her last semester would have the least amount of free time because her courses and outside work are very demanding.
                        <br><br>Ultimately with this story, our group’s main goal is to illustrate these correlations to highlight how leisure and free time differs among colleges pursuing various areas of study because of different workloads, personal interests and social habits.

                    <p>
                        I definitely felt a bit out of my element during this project, as I’m not a very artistic person. However, my teammates definitely helped me a lot in this process to give me pointers on what to do and how to do it. Meanwhile, I was the one who was able to handle all the coding and data visualization parts of the project, so I think we had a good division of labor that made use of our individual talents. As such, I’m pretty satisfied with my role in the project; there’s nothing we did for the project that I really wished I did more or less of. I was more than happy to leave the more creative/artistic decisions to my other team members, while I picked up the slack on the more technical aspects of our project. I wouldn’t really change anything about our project if we were to start over – I’m happy with how it turned out. If I had infinite time and resources, though, I could possibly transfer our project to pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which might make it prettier/more functional, as I could add animations and other bells and whistles. It’d definitely be a hassle to wrangle some aspects of it into a website from scratch, but I think it’s definitely possible to use HTML/CSS/JS to implement some of the features we wanted that we ended up compromising on.
                        <br><br>I feel pretty proud of the data visualizations I made. I think they turned out pretty well. I don’t know if anyone particularly paid attention to how I got the hybrid categories on the plots to show up, and programmatically enforced it being in between the two categories it was composed of so that it looked nice. Might have been more effort than it was worth… but it was satisfying to make it look nice.
                        <br><br>I think my team was great. Again, we had a good division of labor, and it all worked out wonderfully. We didn’t have a particularly rigorous organization - we just talked out any issues, decisions, questions, etc. we had until we reached a consensus. There weren’t particularly many disagreements - we just threw ideas at the wall until we were like “oh, we like this one better than what we had before, let’s do that!” And then we did that. As for division of labor, I handled data visualization and other miscellaneous programming stuff, we each handled our own sections of the digital story, and after that we just tried to distribute individual tasks (making infographic stuff, writing the memo, etc.) among ourselves equally.
                        <br><br>This project definitely had the opportunity to be hell, but I think that I was put into a good group where everyone pulled their own weight. I thought the data collection process was fun given that we got to choose what our data was and how to present it. We definitely had a lot of freedom in choosing what we did, and I really liked that aspect of the project where we were able to make something completely our own and see it turn out okay. Though, it was stressful to see other people’s projects and wonder if ours was up to par. Honestly, there’s not much I would change about this project for future semesters. As long as the group is good, then I don’t think there’s a whole lot that can go wrong with it.
