                        The Hypertext Project was an assignment on making something akin to hypertext fiction, using Walt Whitman's <em>Song of Myself</em> 
                        as our starting text. Then, we were to make "enhancements" to it, which would include links to other sections of 
                        the poem and other sites as we saw fit. <br><br>

                        It's not as heavily interconnected/linked up as the hypertext fiction we explored in class. Still, I think it 
                        turned out pretty enough. <br><br>

                        The process statement is below. <br>

                My primary ethos behind the changes I made in formatting was to reformat
                the text in a way that I thought it would originally be read. Old-timey
                literature like this sounds very flat and nonsensical to the modern mind
                since our vocabulary has changed so much from the day it was written - we
                can grammatically understand the sentence, maybe, but we miss a lot of
                cultural context. When you hear it read aloud, though, when you hear an
                actual human voice put emotion into it? It's not a substitute for a modern
                translation, but it helps comprehension. <br><br>

                The biggest changes that followed this were playing around with line
                breaks and indentation. The "staircase" of words, as Hena put it, was
                meant to evoke the tone of voice of going on and on with listing out terms
                in a list - a list that long looks messy in text, but maybe sounds better
                out loud, and looks better when each element has some space around it. <br><br>

                There was a part in section 4 where Whitman lists out many "sicknesses,"
                beginning with personal afflictions and then moving on to matters of
                national importance. There are sections where Whitman talks about himself
                in a positive way. I tended to interpolate emotions here and format them
                to communicate in a way I thought would send a message. I decreased the
                font size of the personal afflictions and put them in a block, then
                increased the font size of the larger things, as if embarrassed to compare
                two categories of such different magnitudes. I tended to put some words in
                those positive sentences centered in their own lines, as if it was said
                with firm satisfaction. Maybe it's not how Whitman would've wanted it to
                be read, but unless you know how it should be read, I think it's better
                than a flat block of text. <br><br>

                I played around with the font, color, and size of certain words to make
                them pop and break up the monotony of the text wall further. I did this
                with words where the meaning might be more strongly associated with the
                format: color words were colored, visual descriptors had fonts that
                somewhat matched them, negation words were mirrored. <br><br>

                I didn't take much inspiration from anywhere in particular. I added in
                some images where I thought they might fit the most naturally per the
                suggestion of my peer review group. I wanted to keep my formatting
                relatively simple to evoke the same feeling as the very old hypertext
                literature - like Shelley Jackson's "my body".
