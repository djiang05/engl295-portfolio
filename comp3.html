                        This was an assignment for this portfolio specifically where we were told to pull one of our old assignments and 
                        "enhance" it. I chose to pick a blog post I felt particularly strongly about and clean it up a little, using a bit of 
                        know-how from my <a href="hypertextproj.html">Hypertext Project.</a> <br><br>


                        The process statement is below. <br>

                This composition was something we did at the start of the semester, and I don’t think my position has changed much. Sure, I have more tools at my disposal to make digital stories now than I did at the start of the semester, and I’ve made products that could be considered “digital stories” for this class, but it’s not like my willingness to make those stories has changed much.
                <br><br>
                In attempting to make revisions to this piece, I wanted to make it more than just a wall of text. So, I employed some of the things I played around with in my Hypertext Project: indentation, text alignment, a “staircase” pattern – in general, I tried to organize the text in such a way that it amplifies the reading experience, encouraging it to be read more closely to the way I read it in my head. Since I’m using a different font here, I also got to play around more with font weight – something that wasn’t possible with the font that I used in my Hypertext Project. Along this line of thought, I transformed a list of thoughts I had screaming at the authors of the books I read into a cloud of thoughts, which I hope gives off the vibe of a cloud of protest whirling in my brain as I lose my sanity as yet another protagonist throws all logic and reason to the wayside to engage in romance.
                <br><br>
                For the rest of the composition, I cleaned up the language to make it less rambly, and introduced new concepts to clarify stances I had in the original text. Incidentally, I happened to stumble upon a narrative that made the story loop in on itself.
