                I approach art as a consumer, not a producer. I do not consider myself an artist by any means - I lack the vision, the competence, and the dedication to consider myself one. But, here is the “artist statement” of a non-artist.

                <br><br>This class has at least given me practice in working as an artist. And those skills aren’t just going in one ear and out the other – I’m trying to pay attention to things like Hagen & Golombisky, digital works like <em><a href="https://pudding.cool/2024/11/sitters-standers/">Sitters and Standers</a></em>, and even taking inspiration from my peers’ Poetic Data Projects in order to improve my data visualization skills. Being able to effectively communicate the results of my data analysis is important – a sentiment imparted onto me by several of my professors. Besides, it’s just nice to be able to make pretty visualizations that I can feel proud of.

                <br><br>Probably the biggest thing I’m taking away from this class is the resources to find cool examples of digital stories, such as <a href="https://pudding.cool/">pudding.cool</a> . They’ve opened my eyes to what’s possible to do, what I can aspire to try to do, and neat ways of using the medium as a function of the story. Inspiration is valuable – you won’t try to do something if you never think of it. As I said, I lack vision… so piggybacking off of someone else’s vision eliminates at least one third of that puzzle.

                <br><br>I mean, that’s not a bad thing, is it? Don’t artists get inspired by other artists all the time? I mean, sure, good artists probably aren’t derivative… but I don’t need to be making any groundbreaking innovations in the art world any time soon. I just need to make my art not induce vomiting, and that’s good enough for me.

                <br><br>I mean, hey, what was I saying about the power of “acceptable” in the Week 4 blog post?


                <br><br><br>I do think that, over the course of this semester, I tried to come into my own by playing with the medium of whatever I was working in, trying to make it so that the story I told and the medium I tell it in are combined into more than the sum of their parts (UNLIKE <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=40.446796000000035%2C-79.95059400000001&spn=3.787431%2C7.064209&hl=en&gl=us&oe=UTF8&msa=0&z=8&ie=UTF8&mid=1RiR5cfB3JowPmbPRUWXob59yJGQ">MR. PLIMPTON'S REVENGE</a>). I'm limited by my lack of knowledge on very complicated mediums, but I do like how my use of all the features of Google Docs came into play in my Hypertext Project, and I am quite amused at my own performance with the “Man in Hole” poem I wrote for one of my blog posts, which can be found in Design Journal #3. I also tried to go back to Composition #3 and modify it using my newfound perspective and familiarity with digital art that I’ve developed over the course of the semester. Then again, there was a lot of room for improvement to begin with – I wrote the original work at the very start of the semester, and so it was more or less just me rambling and ranting about romance subplots.

                <br><br>I guess that can kind of show my progress over the semester via this portfolio; the Hypertext Project and Composition #3 are both in the same vein, just produced by different Davids at different points in time. (Though, I did put significantly more effort into the Hypertext Project, given that it was an entire project that we were to work on for a few weeks.)

                <br><br>I think that the thing I’m most proud of this semester was the Poetic Data Project. It was really fun to collect data, visualize it, and tell a story. I did take a big risk in taking on all the data visualization on my own rather than just making it in Excel or Google Sheets for marginal benefit, all because I had a vision for how I wanted to display hybrid categories without actually knowing if that was possible and how I would do it. Still, I think it turned out great. It was a good exercise to let me practice my data visualization skills, it was a lot of fun, and I think that it helped me feel as though I had a valuable contribution to the project.
                <br>I also took a big risk in deciding to make this website from scratch via HTML, for similar reasons. Because I thought it would be fun. Because I thought it would be good practice. Because I thought that it would give me more freedom to do what I wanted to do, to realize the vision I had. And from how it’s looking, I’m quite satisfied with it – especially the home page. I daresay that the homepage turned out better than it first looked in my head. Honestly, I kind of ended up on the animations by happenstance by digging through documentation seeing what else I could do – something along those lines of “experimenting with the medium” I was talking about earlier.

                <br><br>I guess these risks are how I challenge myself. Doing more work than I have to, because I like the mechanics of building things in this way, and the freedom it gives me.

                <br><br>Huh… doing art for the mechanics of doing art… maybe I’m beginning to understand modern art.
                <br>But, no. For now, I still don’t understand the artistic merit of throwing paint against a wall. Because unlike some people, I have no pretense that what I make is revolutionary or has extraordinary artistic merit.
